Its a banking SQL. There is different relations related to banking such as
Branch (branch_name, branch_city, assets)
Customer (customer_name, customer_street, customer_city)
Account (account_number, branch_name, balance)
Loan (loan_number, branch_name, amount)
Depositor (customer_name, account_number)
Borrower (customer_name, loan_number)
I have solved different queries related to these relations.
